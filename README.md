emfdetection
============

Arduino code for a cell phone emf detection object. 

Smartphones have become a part of us, but we still do not know how the signals affect our bodies. This project attempts to bring our attention to the phones' electro-magnetic activity, even when the phone is "asleep".

On the Arduino: attach a wire to pin 4 with a 3.3Mohm resistor connecting pin 4 to gnd. 

The circuit and code are based on Aaron Alai's EMF detector circuit. http://www.aaronalai.com/emf-detector.
